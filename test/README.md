# Testing modules

This folder contains test and test modules. In some cases they may be incomplete. 

They are not part of the final project, but have been used experimentally to test functions, processes, communications, etc.

If no file appears at the time you download the repository, do not worry, they are not necessary or essential.

Anyway, I am one of those who believe that everything that is done can be reused, and I don't like to erase anything, even if it is old and disused code. 

You can always learn some of the old code and help in the creation of new code.

In this folder you can find (for now):

    TPC Communication Client & Server.
    These two modules now have their own repository in:
        https://github.com/gabimarti/TinyServerClient    
        
    * tinyserver.py         - Small multi-threaded server, with configurable port, number of clients, 
                              buffer size, and message to receive that kills the process.
                      
    * tinyclient.py         - Client to use with tinyserver.py and to be able to do communication tests. 
                              It also allows you to configure the host, port and message to send.
                      
    
     Examples of short keyloggers code.    
        
    * tinykeylogger01.py    - Shortest example of keylogger in Python. 
                              Exactly eleven lines of pure code.        
                              
    * tinykeylogger02.py    - Second shortest example of keylogger in Python.
                              Now with eight lines of code.
