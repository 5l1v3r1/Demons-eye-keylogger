# GUI Monitor and auxiliary files

This folder contains the Keylogger Monitor.

(PENDING)

* demonseye-monitor. py     - GUI interface used to monitor the keylogger.


### Non GUI monitor

In the root folder you can find the *demonseye-net-search-py* file that allows you to search for the keylogger and receive the keystrokes directly on the screen. It has no GUI, it has no commands, it only receives text.
