# Modules and API information 

I will try to summarize here the most important *URL*s related to the use of the functions and services included in the keylogger, and notes on their configuration.

## Modules

Please, check my file *requirements.txt* which shows all the modules I had installed when I made the development, although it is more than likely that there is a module in the list that is not necessary.

The module that I indicate below are the ones that are sure to be essential.

Install with "pip install module-name-required"

    * pywin32
    * pyWinhook
    * win32gui
    * requests 
    * urllib2
    * mss
    * python-telegram-bot
