# Frequently Asked Questions of Demon's Eye Keylogger

You may find the answer to that question that comes to mind. 
You may also find stupid questions and worse answers. 
In any case, you will have an entertaining reading time.

If you have any questions to ask me, do not hesitate to do so.


##### Q: What is the purpose of this project?
 
- Only and exclusively educational. Know how a keylogger works from its development (and the study I have done of other keyloggers), learn to program in Python, and deepen and strengthen my knowledge of Systems and network communications.  
      

##### Q: Why this name?

- For two reasons. The first is because a keylogger is a diabolical program that allows you to see what other people write on their computer. And the second one is motivated by the fact that while I develop I like to listen to music from groups like **Deep Purple**, which precisely has a song with this name.

##### Q: Hey! where have you made this banner so beautiful that it appears in the header of the code?

##### Q: Why are there some comments in English and others in Spanish within the code?

- Initially I started to post comments in Spanish. Later, when making the decision to make the public project I thought it would be better to put the comments in English. Even so, sometimes I forget, other times I put it directly, and in some cases I have kept both languages. I beg your pardon for this mix, and I suppose that in the future I will only leave the comments in English.

 
##### Q: Why are two users contributing to the project on GitHub?

- Just don't make distinctions if the updates are from the one user or another. I'm myself. :)

    The first reason was to test the operation of GitHub with several users and see that the commits were executed correctly. 
Here you can see that many stupid tests appear that have simply helped me to experiment and understand how version control worked.

    The second reason is that the keylogger has been developed mainly within a virtual machine. 
And in this virtual machine I have not used any personal account, since in addition to the development of the keylogger, 
I have done other tests with malware and other cybersecurity issues. 
So as a precaution, connections to GitHub were made with a different account.
