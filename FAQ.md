Q: Why are two users contributing to the project on GitHub?

A: Just don't make distinctions if the updates are from the user "gabimarti" or "foratnegre". I'm myself. :)

The first reason was to test the operation of GitHub with several users and see that the commits were executed correctly. Here you can see that many stupid tests appear that have simply helped me to experiment and understand how version control worked.

The second reason is that the keylogger has been developed mainly within a virtual machine. And in this virtual machine I have not used any personal account, since in addition to the development of the keylogger, I have done other tests with malware and other cybersecurity issues. So as a precaution, connections to GitHub were made with a different account.

 Q: What is the purpose of this project?
 
 A: Only and exclusively educational. Know how a keylogger works from its development (and the study I have done of other keyloggers), learn to program in Python, and deepen and strengthen my knowledge of Systems and network communications.
